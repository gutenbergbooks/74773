<p class="drop-cap">IT was an April day in the South—not
windy and blustering, with the
remembrances of March still clinging
about it, but warm and lovely, mild
and balmy, with spring beauty and
promise of good over everything.
The grass was springing everywhere,
and the buds on the trees were bursting
into blossom, and one could gather
tender leaves and delicate sprays of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
white and hold them with the tender,
caressing touch which we give to all
that heralds spring. It was a good
day to breathe the soft, mild air, to
be among the growing things and
dismiss winter from the mind; and,
above all, it was one of those days
when the restless feeling we all have
sometimes returns in full force, and
the thought of coming life and energy
in the natural world fills the
mind with a longing to do something
more than sit still and enjoy.</p>

<p>All this—not exactly in this form,
but the substance of this—with a restless,
unsatisfied feeling, was possessing
and fast getting control of Tom
Alson, as he sat on a box in front of
a store in Huntsville, idly tapping
one foot after the other against its
wooden sides. He had anything but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
an ambitious, energetic look, but then
Tom never showed his feelings, and
any one gazing at him would hardly
have imagined that at this very moment
he was longing to go out into
the world and “do something.”</p>

<p>Certainly the man who came up to
him just then had very little idea of
the lofty thought in which Tom was indulging,
for he gave him only a hasty
glance before he addressed him.</p>

<p>“Say, boy, want to hire out?” asked
the man.</p>

<p>Tom started and roused himself:
“I was not thinking of it, sir,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“Well, think of it now, then; I am
trying to find boys to work for Mr.
Sutherland on his plantation, about
twenty miles out. They are growing
corn and cotton. I’d be glad to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
you go; give you six dollars a month
and board.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Tom; “I think I
will not hire out this summer.”</p>

<p>“Oh think again! Six dollars a
month is no mean pay, and I’ve
a lot of Huntsville niggers going
along.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Tom again, decidedly,
and rising as he spoke, as if
not wishing to continue the conversation.</p>

<p>“What’s to hinder you?” asked
the man.</p>

<p>“I am going to school, sir,” returned
the boy, knowing that this
would put a stop to the urging; and
it was successful, for the man, with
a few coarse words about “niggers
and education,” turned suddenly and
walked away, and Tom, with his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
in his pockets, sauntered off in an opposite
direction, whistling.</p>

<p>He came up to his home by and by,
and found his sister Martha in a chair
outside the door, busied with some
sewing. He sat down on a step near
and watched her swift-moving hand
in silence for some minutes, with his
eyes on her work and his thoughts a
long way off.</p>

<p>“Has mother come back?” he
asked, at length.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom,” replied Martha, with
a little sigh, “but she didn’t succeed
in getting any work. I do not see
how we are going to get along. I
think I shall try to see if I can get
something to do.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that, too,” said
Tom. “There’s a man here to-day
who wants hands to go twenty miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
out. He wanted me, but I told him
‘No.’”</p>

<p>Martha stitched away in silence.</p>

<p>“I’d go,” said Tom, suddenly, “but
there’s the school; I could not give
that up.”</p>

<p>“Not for Jesus, Tom?” asked Martha,
looking round with a little smile.</p>

<p>“<i>Would</i> it be for Jesus, Martha,”
said Tom, earnestly, “to give up school
and go to work, neglecting my education
meanwhile?”</p>

<p>“Think about it, Tom, and remember
what Paul did for Jesus.”</p>

<p>Tom did think. The conversation
ceased between them entirely, and
the fresh spring breezes came from
the South, laden with the breath of
flowers, and passed gently by the two
seated before the cabin door, one of
them so busy with his decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>When Tom, at length, rose and
moved off, Martha could not tell his
thought, although she peered anxiously
into his face to see if possible
what lay there, but it was unmoved,
and he did not meet her look of inquiry
with any return, but passed out
of the gate, swinging it after him, and
walking off toward the quarter of the
town where his father was at work.
He looked very grave when the two
came in together at dinner-time, and
hurried off toward the school-room
before his sister was ready. She
watched him a little anxiously all the
afternoon, but the grave, intent face
did not once relax its gravity, and the
lines of soberness remained even after
the pleasant afternoon session came to
a close. Martha waited for her brother
some minutes, with the hope that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
she might have one of their customary
talks on their way home, but he did
not come away, so she went on alone.</p>

<p>It was not until an hour later, while
she was busily weeding the little garden,
that Tom came up and stopped
at her side.</p>

<p>“Martha, I’m going,” he said, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Tom! why, Tom—going! when
and what for,” she said, starting and
turning round toward him.</p>

<p>“Going to-morrow, Martha, and for
Jesus,” he replied, quietly.</p>

<p>Martha turned back again suddenly
without remark, and industriously
weeded the springing grass from
around the young plants.</p>

<p>Tom waited several minutes, and
then spoke again:</p>

<p>“Are you not glad of this, Martha?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>She dropped the shovel with which
she had been working, turned toward
him, and lifting her hands to her head
in a nervous way, replied, with quivering
lips:</p>

<p>“That I am glad, you know, but
oh I shall lose my brother!”</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes fell and his mouth
twitched.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to see Miss Mason,” he
said, after a minute, “to bid her good-bye.
She says I must send her a letter.
That is a great blessing which
we did not always have, Martha—we
may write to each other. That is
good.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Martha knew it as well as
Tom, and I think it was the thought
of this more than almost anything
else which served to keep them in
some degree of cheerfulness during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the remainder of his stay. It was
not long, only so many short hours
Martha almost counted the minutes.
It was like Tom to act in a moment
when the question of duty came
home to him, and although Martha
knew this, yet she had been surprised,
after all, at his sudden acting upon
her suggestion. What if Tom should
sicken or be in any want so far from
home?—for to Martha the distance
seemed immense. Would she not
then be sorry she had ever encouraged
him? But those precious letters!
How thankful she felt that she
could write, and that though miles
were between them, yet words could
pass from one to the other!</p>

<p>How Tom felt no one knew. He
hid his feelings always. Martha was
the only one who ever had a glimpse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and she only now and then. He
counted the cost at every step, yet
still he had gone back to his acquaintance
of the morning, and agreed with
him to work on the plantation during
the summer. His father had listened,
too, when he proposed it, and although
he would have liked to keep his boy
at home, yet work was scarce, and he
could not always find means to live;
so Tom must go. He had taken leave
of his teacher and the school-room
quite calmly, to all appearance, and no
one knew how hard the struggle was
to give up all this for Jesus. Yet it
was this thought which kept him up
through it all, and watching Martha’s
grave face as she bent over his box
placing his things together, he longed
to tell her his source of comfort. But
perhaps he needed it himself more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
than she did, for to one of his disposition
to go from home and mingle
among strangers was very hard, very
much against his will. Yet as he
looked at it, he thought perhaps God
had sent him just this trial to make
him better, and that he might have
something for him to do for his service
in the country. And so his courage
did not quite fail.</p>

<p>How his eyes lingered the next
morning upon everything about his
home, trying as he did to impress
each little portion of the house-furnishing
upon his memory! It seemed
as if he could not lose sight of his
sister Martha’s face. His eyes followed
her everywhere. It was almost
strange, the devoted affection which
had sprung up between the two; and
it was so hard, just as they were helping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
one another along the narrow
way through the journey of life, to
be obliged to part.</p>

<p>But it came, late in the afternoon—the
parting—and was over, and Tom
found himself in the car looking
out at the country, green, and fresh,
and beautiful, and trying to realize
how long it would be before the familiar
faces would be near him again.
Of all Tom’s boy friends there was
but one who was of this company, and
he, although a school-mate, knew Tom
only slightly. But he was alone too,
and so after a while, seeing the empty
seat beside Tom, he came and sat
down.</p>

<p>“How do you think you’ll like it
out there?” he asked, as Tom turned
round.</p>

<p>“I have hardly thought,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Tom. “I do not know anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you a heap then. It’s a
big plantation, with quarters for the
hands not far from the house. The
master lives in a big, white mansion,
and has charge of the cotton and cornfields.
My brother is there, and he
says it’s a pretty good place. Pay is regular,
and that’s the most, you know.”</p>

<p>“Where shall we stay? Do you
know?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. I ’spects likely we’ll
be quartered with some old auntie or
other. I don’t much care. They
have jolly times after hours—breakdowns
and dances. Hi! it’s gay fun!”</p>

<p>Tom’s heart sank. He looked out
of the window and saw the great trees
with their tops just lighted with the
rising moon, heard the shrill cry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
the mocking-bird, and saw the fireflies
lighting up the woods with a
thousand tiny lamps. Cool the evening
air came across his face, with the
motion of the car hurrying on through
one of the most glorious countries on
which the sun shines. Tom saw it
all, and loved it for the sake of Him
who made it, but his heart was heavy
with the grief of parting, the sting
of poverty which sent him away from
home, and the prospect before him.
Very rebellious, very discontented, his
thoughts were for a few minutes, until
some old auntie going out with the
company, and who had learned with
the experience of years to leave her burden
of care in His hands “who careth
for us,” struck up a hymn, and as the
voices one by one joined in with her,
until the car was full of the melody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
which floated out upon the evening
air among the moss-laden trees, Tom’s
head sank and rested upon the seat in
front, and the tears came—tears of
penitence and joy—as he listened:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Oh God’s got a plenty for all of his children—</div>
<div class="indent">Sit all around God’s table;</div>
<div class="verse">For God’s got plenty for all his children—</div>
<div class="indent">Sit all around God’s table.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>There was a prayer for help and
courage as Tom listened, and after it
was finished his head was lifted with
new resolve. He was immediately
attacked again by the boy at his side.</p>

<p>“You went to see Miss Mason yesterday,
did you not?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom, with a softened
remembrance of the words of kindliness
and cheer given him by his
teacher. “Yes, I did; I went to bid
her good-bye. How did you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“Because I went myself, and she
told me you were of the company.
She said you would help me get
along.”</p>

<p>“I will, all that I can,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“She said you had got religion. Is
that so?”</p>

<p>Tom gave an instant’s glance out
into the night again. “It is ‘known
of me,’ then,” he thought; and finally
said, with a little smile which showed
more than anything else could have
done the value that religion was to
him, “I love the Lord Jesus.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you and I will do
for each other,” said the boy, a little
mystified by Tom’s smile and moving
uneasily in his seat. “I am up to all
sorts of shines.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ll do very nicely for
one another,” replied Tom, brightly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
seeing, with joy, part of the Master’s
work already at his hands. “We are
school-mates, you know, and both love
to study; that ought to make us
friends if nothing else does. We will
work together in the evenings.”</p>

<p>The boy roused instantly, and they
fell into earnest talk of the ways and
means for study, the lessons they had
already learned, the remembrance of
happy school-hours, and a thousand
other things which to these boys, who
until lately had never known the joys
of school-life, were the brightest spots
in their existence.</p>

<p>So the miles were passed over, and
the beautiful Southern country left
behind: the short journey—so long to
many—was accomplished, and at a
little station-house, within about a
mile of the plantation, they were at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
length set down, fifty souls in all, and
took up their line of march. Tom and
his friend Jimmy Harrison walked on
silently with the rest. The final landing
at the station had not been pleasant.
The agent who had them in
charge was not kind, and the people
were feeling very unpleasantly. Tom
had rather better control of himself
than the rest, for with the first shock
and rebellious thoughts, as the words
of harshness and anger fell upon his
ears, his soul went up to God in a
prayer for patience and strength, to
keep down any feelings of unkindness.
Then turning to Jimmy, whose quick
temper had been roused by the rough
treatment, with a few gentle kindly
words of encouragement he put his
arm through his, and led him forward
in the line of march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>And long afterward, when the summer
breezes would bring to him the
cool fragrant breath of plants and
growing flowers, he was always reminded
of this first night, when the
work which he longed to do for Jesus
commenced; and knowing the blessed
influence which followed all through
that long, hard summer, he ever after
thanked God and took courage.</p>

</div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TOM and Jimmy were quartered
with an old colored woman called
Aunt Margaret, one of the family
servants, who in her old age had been
furnished with a tiny brick house near
the mansion, in which she had lived
some years by herself. The house
contained three rooms, two on the
lower floor and one above stairs, and
the master, who had dismissed the
agent upon their arrival, and superintended
the settling of the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
himself, placed the two boys, Tom and
Jimmy, in this upper room. Tom was
greatly pleased on account of the quiet
which he thought would result from
their removal from the cabins or
quarters of the rest of the hands, and
pictured to himself many happy hours
of study in the room up-stairs.</p>

<p>But he discovered his mistake very
soon. Aunt Margaret was very fond
of company, and the cabin was the
common resort of half the working-people
on the place, and study, to say
nothing of quiet, was out of the question.</p>

<p>It was on the second evening after
his arrival, at the close of the first
day’s work in the field, that Tom took
out his books. How sadly and mournfully
he had missed his school all day,
no one knew but himself; and now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
took his books and slate with no small
degree of pleasure.</p>

<p>“What’s the chile gwine to do?”
asked the old woman, peering at him
over her spectacles.</p>

<p>“Going to read and study a while
by your candle, Aunt Margaret, if I
may,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Laws, chile! you may do as you
likes, for all me,” she returned with a
shake of her head; “but it ’pears like
there’ll be mighty little quiet here to-night.”</p>

<p>Tom soon found it so, to his utter
dismay. First, Jimmy came in with
one or two others, talking loud and
making a confusion.</p>

<p>“Are you going to study with me
to-night?” asked Tom as he came
up to the table and glanced at the
books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“No, I’m not <i>that</i>,” replied the
boy; “it’s larks I’m after, and if you
wasn’t a stupid, you wouldn’t either.”</p>

<p>Tom was disappointed, and bent his
head over his books silently, and
tried to work. But there was no
study to be had there. The room
gradually filled with women and men,
and attention to books was impossible.
He gave it up at last, but not before
he had two or three laughing remarks
addressed to him. He closed his book
and rested his head wearily on his
hand. He concluded he would go up-stairs.
“I am not used to such company
as this,” he thought with a new
feeling creeping into his heart. “I
will go away, and just show them all
that I am made of a different sort
from them.”</p>

<p>Then he suddenly bethought him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
how wrongly he was acting in thus
putting himself above his fellows; so
he immediately raised his head and
joined in the conversation.</p>

<p>It was no pleasure to him, but he
stayed half an hour, and then, seeing
he could go without giving offence to
any one, he gladly gathered up his
books and went off up-stairs. A candle
was a luxury not to be indulged in,
but as Tom ascended the stairs he
saw that the moonlight was pouring
in through the one window, so that the
room was quite light. He put his
books away, and seating himself on
the floor under the window, which
was very low, he leaned his head on
his arm upon the sill and began to
think.</p>

<p>It was a long, sober thought. With
quick understanding he saw very soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
what a battle the summer would be to
him, and how hard it would be for
him to accomplish his aims. He was
resolved upon one thing: study he
must and would, if every leisure minute
of the noontide hour was given
up to it. Then, again, he must do
some work for Jesus. The summer
must not yet pass without some deed
accomplished whereby his Master
should be glorified. He realized that
to this end he must make himself familiar
with the hands about the place—not
only with those who came from
Huntsville, but also with the old
family servants. The dangers, the
temptations accompanying such a
course, if they occurred to him at all,
did not present themselves in their
dangerous form—the temptation that
while leading others he might himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
be led away—that his faith might
fail or his courage droop. The whole
armor of God was the only thing
which could keep him from all the
ills and troubles thus presented. He
did not know how much trial was
before him, but he <i>did</i> know that he
needed a stronger arm than his own
to lead him, and he looked above for
strength and shelter.</p>

<p>The trial came first in a most unexpected
direction. Jimmy, in all good
humor, reported that Tom “had got
religion,” and to those to whom he
told it it was a very bad recommendation,
and they held themselves aloof;
and not only that, but they would
amuse themselves with sundry jokes
at his expense. Tom was astonished
and wounded. He could not imagine
where they could have heard it, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
prevented, for a time, the advancement
he wished to make in their regard.
He tried his best. By every
effort in his power he endeavored to
gain friends among this new company,
and in a few instances he succeeded
immediately; in others not so well;
and often it was impossible to have a
talk with those whose friendship he
wished most to gain, on account of
their leisure-time being so much
occupied with dances in the great
barn.</p>

<p>The studying was scarcely better at
first. It was very hard between his
bites of corn-bread in the noon-spell
to give his attention to looking out
words in the dictionary, or mastering
what seemed to him such profound
problems in arithmetic. There was
an hour before supper which was his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
own, and that was devoted, half to
study and half to Bible-reading. It
was very hard work to stand firmly
by his resolution, and go after his
books at the close of a warm, tiresome
day, and study so persistently
just when the twilight was growing
beautiful and the people were all resting
before their cabin doors. Sometimes
he was quite discouraged, and
almost determined to give up.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when he had been
perhaps two weeks on the plantation,
he was coming home from work just
at sunset, with his jacket thrown over
his arm, warm and tired with his day’s
labor, and rather dreading than otherwise
the hour of study which was before
him, when suddenly, as he passed
near the mansion, the master stepped
from the doorway and accosted him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Tom stopped and waited for what he
might have to say.</p>

<p>“Is your name Tom Alson?” he
asked, feeling in his coat pocket and
drawing out a number of letters.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he answered, his heart
bounding with a hope he hardly dared
to own.</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ve a letter for you,”
he said, selecting one from a number.
He scanned it curiously for a
few minutes, and then gave it to the
boy, adding, “Can you read writing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tom; “I can
read writing, and write myself. I am
much obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” answered Mr. Sutherland,
carelessly. “Do you know who
wrote that direction?”</p>

<p>Tom looked at the letter which his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
fingers held so lovingly, and replied
with a very bright face,</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—my teacher.”</p>

<p>“Is she white?” inquired the master.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sir! She is a Northern
lady.”</p>

<p>“Well, go off and enjoy your letter,”
said Mr. Sutherland, dismissing him,
and turning away pleased with the
eager look of welcome the boy had
given the letter.</p>

<p>And Tom, glad to be so dismissed,
ran off to his seat under the trees,
leaving his books to take care of themselves
while he read the precious letter—the
first one he had ever received
in his life.</p>

<p>There were two, he found, when he
opened the envelope. One with all
the dainty prettiness of French paper
and stamped “M,” in the delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
handwriting of Miss Mason, and the
other in the round, school-girl hand
of Martha. Ah! how every word of
those two letters went to Tom’s heart!
Martha’s was full of home news, every
item well expressed, because her heart
was in this the first letter written to
her brother Tom. It was penned in
good spirits, for her mother had been
able to obtain a few days’ work.</p>

<p>“I am looking for a place for myself,”
she wrote, “and hope to get one,
but I have not seen any opportunity
as yet, and sometimes I almost wish I
had gone with you.”</p>

<p>“I am glad she didn’t,” thought
Tom.</p>

<p>“Our Sunday-school has been so
pleasant lately,” she continued, “I
only wish you could be here. Mr.
Allen gave us some beautiful illuminated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
texts last Sunday. I had been
thinking about you all the afternoon,
and had been wishing you could have
heard Mr. Allen’s talk, and I am
afraid I was feeling a little wrong and
disappointed that you could not be
with us, when Mr. Allen laid upon
my desk my little text. I did not
wish any more, Tom; I just believed
what it said, and kept still. Now I
am going to send it to you, and if you
have—as I have no doubt you often
do, good as you are—any longings for
home that grow too strong, then here
is my text;” and Tom read in red
and gold letters on a bit of card which
fell from the letter:</p>

<p>“Trust in the Lord, and wait patiently
for him.”</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes were blinded for several
minutes, so that he could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
see to read Miss Mason’s kind note.
It told him just what he wanted
most to know—all the school news;
how Martha was getting on, what
new songs they were learning, and
how his own class was prospering.
“And knowing that you had your
books with you,” she added, “and
thinking you might have time for
study, I have marked on a slip of
paper all that your class has learned,
and a few directions which will help
you to study for yourself.</p>

<p>“And now,” she concluded, “I do
not know that you need counsel, but
let me just remind you that you are a
soldier of Jesus Christ, and that it is
a part of a soldier’s duty to see that
his comrades are saved from danger;
so, my dear boy, try and bring back
to God some who are still outside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
fold. We all have work to do for
Jesus, you know.”</p>

<p>Tom’s heart rested. He did not
see how he could be sorrowful with
these two bits of cheer coming to him
when he felt so weary and heartsick.
He was not so any more—that night, at
any rate—and the letters were shown
to many admiring eyes. Jimmy
opened his very wide.</p>

<p>“Had a letter from Miss Mason?”
exclaimed he. “My sakes! let’s read;”
but Tom could not do that.</p>

<p>“I’d rather not, Jimmy,” said he,
looking at Jimmy’s fingers and thinking
of the delicate paper, “but I’ll
tell you all she said.”</p>

<p>He told so much about school and
the work she had sent him that
Jimmy’s slumbering ambition was
aroused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“I declare, Tom,” said he, “I haven’t
studied a bit since I came; have you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom, “a good deal.”</p>

<p>“Are you up with your class?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh dear! and I promised to study
with you. I’ll begin this very night.”</p>

<p>And he did, and added thereby for
a short time much to Tom’s happiness.
For a while he gave his evenings
pretty steadily, but at noon he
was inexorable.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he said—“noon is for
rest.”</p>

<p>The next day Tom was very busy
shelling corn for the planting. He
had stationed himself on the doorstep
of the barn, and as he shelled
and the kernels fell from the cob, he
thought of his two letters; and suddenly
thinking of some task Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Mason assigned him, and not being
able distinctly to recall it, he took out
her letter and laid it open near him,
and tried to puzzle out the meaning
of an example she had given him,
continuing his work while he did so.
As he was still thus engaged, the noon-bell
struck, and throwing down his ear
of corn, he drew a pencil and paper
out of his pocket and proceeded carefully
to write out the problem. So
busy was he that he did not perceive
that any one had come up until his
master’s voice spoke.</p>

<p>“What are you busy about, Tom?”
he asked.</p>

<p>He looked up suddenly, and then
rose out of respect to his master.
“I was copying out an example my
teacher sent me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is that your writing? Let me see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
it.” He reached for the paper on
which Tom had been working, and
eyed it narrowly.</p>

<p>“Would you like to see my teacher’s
letter, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I should,” he replied; so
Tom produced it, and it was read
very attentively. “How long did you
go to school?” he asked, as he finished
it and laid it back into Tom’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Two years, sir.”</p>

<p>“And can you do all those examples
your teacher has given you?”</p>

<p>“I think so, sir. I am trying them
now.”</p>

<p>“Is this the way you always pass
your noon-time rest?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“The world has turned about,” said
the master, with a curious, puzzled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
look, and then he turned about himself.
But he had not gone three steps
before he came back again.</p>

<p>“Say, my boy,” he said, “come up
to the house after supper to-night.
Tell Aunt Dinah, the cook, that master
said you were to come to the
library. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tom; “I will
come, sir.”</p>

<p>So the master went away, and Tom
returned to his task, so intent and interested
that it never entered into his
mind to conjecture why he was wanted
in the evening at the mansion.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TOM found, however, when he told
the incident to the people who
were assembled in Aunt Margaret’s
cabin when he came in at night, that it
created quite a sensation. The idea of
any one of them being sent for into
the master’s library was a wonder,
and Tom found himself a lion among
them. He did not feel the least elated,
however. He only feared, when he
came to think of it, that his master’s
discovery of his knowledge would lead
to his dismissal, and he had felt as if
he was just beginning to gain the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
friendship of his fellow-workers which
he so much wished to have. Therefore
it was with rather a grave face
and sober step that he walked in the
gathering twilight toward the mansion.
Aunt Dinah was standing on
the back porch, throwing corn and
feed to the chickens, who, having
grown tame from long acquaintance,
were crowding close around her, in
order to get each one a full share of
the evening meal.</p>

<p>Tom came up and touched his cap.
“Auntie,” said he, “has Mr. Sutherland
finished his supper?”</p>

<p>Now Aunt Dinah was crabbed, and
she determined, when she saw him
coming, that she would send him off
rather quicker than he came, but
the touched cap and voice of respect
went to just the right place in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
heart. “Sure, honey, he’s done
supper,” she said. “What did you
want with him?”</p>

<p>“He bade me come up after tea,”
replied Tom, “and he said you would
show me the way to the library.” Tom
rose higher in Aunt Dinah’s regard
immediately. In her own words, “If
marster wanted one of them field
hands in the lib’ry, it meant sumthin’,
sure enough.”</p>

<p>Therefore, with a little smoothing
touch to her apron, she led the way
through the matted hall, and knocked
at one of the doors which opened from
it. “This is the library,” she said,
and so left him.</p>

<p>A little girl came and opened the
door—a sweet-looking, black-eyed
child of about seven years old—and
held it open as he stepped in. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Sutherland lifted his eyes from a
bundle of papers, and seeing who it
was, said, “Ah! here you are. Just sit
down a few minutes and I shall be
able to attend to you.”</p>

<p>Tom seated himself quietly, glad of
the few minutes given him to examine
the pretty room. Called a library out
of compliment, it was more like a tiny
drawing-room, so many little things
of elegance were gathered here. The
taste of the owner had full play, and
showed itself rather too fond of gilt
and bright colors, but at the same
time toned down by a few Parian
figures and antique vases, which
showed where the wife had been at
work. Tom looked at her, after his
survey of the room, with eyes which
certainly did not lack admiration. A
delicate, fair woman, with the languid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
manner characteristic of her countrywomen,
but with an air of refinement
and culture resting upon every move
of her hand and turn of her head.
A vision of beauty such as Tom had
never seen before. The little girl who
had opened the door for him was
seated at her mother’s feet, very
industriously engaged in undressing a
large doll, and at the same time singing
softly to herself—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Jesus loves me—this I know,</div>
<div class="verse">For the Bible tells me so.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>There she would stop, hum the remainder
of the tune, and then go back
to the beginning again. Tom wondered
whether she knew the rest of the verse,
and was longing to tell her, when his
master called him, and he ceased to
listen. “Tom,” said he, “I find
you can write much better than I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
can—(my education was neglected
somehow)” he added in parenthesis,
moving uneasily in his chair, with a
glance at his wife—“and I have much
trouble in making the merchants
comprehend the accounts. I thought
perhaps you might know how to
decipher them, and in that case I
thought I would employ you to copy
them, spending say an hour every
evening. Of course you will be paid,”
he added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sutherland looked up from
her delicate work, and eyed the boy as
he bent over the papers Mr. Sutherland
laid before him.</p>

<p>“Can this boy read?” she asked,
indolently.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied her husband.</p>

<p>“What does he do about the place?”</p>

<p>“He is a field hand,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>“He had better confine his attention
to corn and cotton than serve you as
an amanuensis. You are spoiling the
hands,” she added, impatiently.</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes never wandered from
his paper, but he lost not a word, and
the firm set of lips showed him no indifferent
listener.</p>

<p>“Can you read these?” asked the
master with no reply to his wife’s
observation.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I think so.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, let me hear them.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i051">

</figure>

<p>So Tom read aloud the month’s report
of the number of hands employed,
the wages of each, the amount of work
performed and the expenses of the
place. It was all correctly done, and
then the two fell to work—the master
arranging the books for Tom’s future
work, and the boy copying. There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>was nothing very elegant about the
writing, but it was a round, even hand,
very plain and distinct. Yet as he
wrote Tom was troubled. He
wondered if his Master knew that
these business affairs were all fully
understood by him. Mr. Sutherland’s
books were very simple, and, with
Tom’s late knowledge of arithmetic,
very easily understood. He wondered
if his master realized that one of his
field hands comprehended all the
business of the plantation.</p>

<p>By and by, when for a few minutes
both came to a standstill, Tom spoke:</p>

<p>“Mr. Sutherland, do you know
that I understand all this work I am
copying.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me you understand
the losses and gains during the
month?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sutherland looked annoyed and
perplexed, and his wife laughed and
remarked that he had better take her
advice and send the boy back to his
cotton.</p>

<p>“I would not care, Bertha,” he replied,
“if I were only sure I could
trust the boy.”</p>

<p>“Of what are you afraid, Mr. Sutherland?”
asked Tom, with a little fire
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Only of your reporting the state
of affairs at Aunt Margaret’s gatherings,”
he replied.</p>

<p>“I shall not do that, sir,” said Tom,
firmly.</p>

<p>“But the question is,” said Mr.
Sutherland, “whether I can trust your
word.”</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes certainly flashed fire for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
a moment; all his old spirit of unrestrained
passion ran through him,
sending the blood throbbing all over
his body, trembling on his lips, dancing
in his eyes, gathering on his forehead,
and causing the fingers that
held the pen to close upon it like a
vice. This lasted for a minute, and
then remembering his love for the
Lord Jesus, and at the same time that
the master could not know how well
he could be trusted, the fingers relaxed
their grasp, the brow cleared,
the lips unbent and formed a smile,
and the eyes dropped.</p>

<p>“I hope I may be trusted, sir. Will
you try me?” he asked, quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will,” replied Mr. Sutherland,
who had watched the play of
feature, and understood a little, although
not half, of the boy’s thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>So they fell to work again—the
little battle over and the victory won,
and a battle-song of triumph in Tom’s
heart, for “he that ruleth his own
spirit is greater than he that taketh
a city.”</p>

<p>By and by, when the minutes had
made an hour and more, the books
were closed. The master’s little girl
had come round near her father’s
chair, and stood there holding on to
the arm of the chair, swinging to and
fro, and singing, “Jesus loves me,”
as Tom and Mr. Sutherland finished
the evening’s work with arrangements
to resume it at the same hour on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Then Tom turned to the little
girl:</p>

<p>“Miss Lillie, do you know the rest
of that verse?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>“No,” she replied, stopping short;
“do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom; “I know all
the hymn.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, sing it,” she demanded.</p>

<p>Tom looked toward Mrs. Sutherland,
but her eyes were turned away,
so he looked down into the waiting
face upturned toward him, and softly
and gently gave the sweet words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Jesus loves me—this I know,</div>
<div class="verse">For the Bible tells me so;</div>
<div class="verse">Little ones to him belong;</div>
<div class="verse">They are weak, but he is strong.</div>
<div class="indent4">Yes, Jesus loves me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Jesus loves me—he who died:</div>
<div class="verse">Heaven’s gate to open wide;</div>
<div class="verse">He will wash away my sin,</div>
<div class="verse">Let his little child come in.</div>
<div class="indent4">Yes, Jesus loves me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Jesus loves me—he will stay</div>
<div class="verse">Close beside me all the way;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
<div class="verse">If I love him when I die,</div>
<div class="verse">He will take me home on high.</div>
<div class="indent4">Yes, Jesus love me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>She had kept her black eyes fixed
upon his face throughout the hymn,
and when he had finished, seeing his
earnestness, she asked:</p>

<p>“Do <i>you</i> love Jesus?”</p>

<p>How it startled him! He glanced
quickly toward the two listeners, but
Mrs. Sutherland had not changed her
position, and the master’s eyes were
on the floor and his face unreadable.</p>

<p>It was a pity they were not looking
at him, for as his eyes came back to
the questioner and saw how she was
awaiting his reply, all the new love
and allegiance flashed back upon him,
and his reply was given with a smile
that was worth seeing.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I love the Lord Jesus.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>Then he rose and moved toward the
door, but his bare feet on the carpet
made no sound. He stopped at the
threshold and waited for a word, but
none came; so he said: “Good-evening,
Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland.” The
mistress dismissed him with a little
bow, without raising her head, and the
master roused and replied,</p>

<p>“Ah! going? Well, good-night.
I’ll see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>So Tom went out into the night,
clear and beautiful, with innumerable
stars shining down out of heaven, and
the rich earth lying in the beauty of
its early spring dress all about him.
Down at the quarters he could see
sparkling lights from the fires which
the open doors left in view. From
the little log-barn, long ago out of use,
came the voices of the people who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
were holding a meeting there. He
listened a moment, but he could not
catch the words, so he walked nearer,
and stopped beneath the tree where
he had read his precious letters, and
there the words came distinctly to his
ear, borne to him by the sweet evening
breeze:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“My good Lord’s been here,</div>
<div class="indent2">Has been here, has been here:</div>
<div class="verse">My good Lord’s been here,</div>
<div class="verse">And blessed my soul, and gone.</div>
<div class="indent2">Seeker, where were you</div>
<div class="verse">When my good Lord was here?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“My good Lord’s been here,” said
Tom softly to himself, and then he
kneeled down and thanked God
humbly and gratefully both for the
opportunity he had given him, and
also for this night’s victory. No pride
of the task assigned him entered his
mind; and when, after curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
questioning in Aunt Margaret’s cabin
as to the result of his visit to the mansion,
he told them that Mr. Sutherland
wanted some writing done by
him, he had no pride in the announcement;
and when he saw, as he could
not help seeing, how he rose immediately
in the estimation of his
questioners, he was very glad, only
because it might help in his work for
Jesus.</p>

<p>It was Tom’s plan to start a little
Sunday-school after a while. He felt
very timid about it, and although he
had taken no decided step in the
matter, he had gradually won his way
to the hearts of the people on the
place, and by frequent acts of kindness
was becoming rather popular among
them. As I said before, this was very
dangerous. He might forget for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
whom he was working, and learn to
think only of himself. This could not
be yet, however, for he still looked to
Jesus for help and strength, and while
he did so he was secure.</p>

<p>As soon as it was noised abroad that
the master needed Tom’s services to
write for him every night, the respect
for Tom increased, and put him in the
way of more work. The people who,
like Tom, had come to the plantation
for the summer, came to him to have
letters written and messages sent to
their absent friends, so Tom’s hands
began to be quite full; and always
intent as he was upon his work for
Jesus, he would send a message or a
bit of advice or counsel to the friends
of those for whom he wrote, and so his
influence became widespread. How
much pleasure he took in answering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the two letters which had brought him
so much comfort was best known to
himself, but his face was brighter
and his step lighter for days afterward.</p>

<p>There was one face, however, which
was steadily set against his growing
popularity from the first. This was
Jimmy, his school-mate in Huntsville
and his room-mate here. After a few
evenings, he gave up study and withdrew
himself from his friend more and
more. He knew almost as much as
Tom, but he cared nothing at all about
it, except to be envious of his friend’s
position. “I can write as well as he,”
he would often say, but when asked to
send a letter, he would always refuse.
So he continually boasted of the
amount he knew, but would never
show his knowledge. Their rooming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
together had been pleasant at first, but
of late there had been scarcely a word
between them. Jimmy shunned him
on every occasion, and when forced
into his company would say sneering
things with regard to Tom’s “great
learning,” as he called it. Yet still
Tom was uniformly kind and polite,
and when those around would silence
Jimmy in some one of his insolent
speeches, his replies came always
mild and gentle. This conduct gained
for him more friends and more kindly
attention to the words he spoke for
Jesus than anything else could have
done. It does not take learned minds
to know when those around them live
according to their profession.</p>

<p>Not a word of all this reached
Martha; and when, months after, he
told her of the struggle of these days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
she knew that only the strength given
him from above had enabled him to
bear it. No, the letters that came as
a piece of freshness and unbounded
pleasure to Martha were full of whatever
Tom could find of love and cheer
to put in them. Of his efforts in the
work for Jesus he told her, with a
longing to do more, but there was no
mention of trials or difficulties, and
the letters were read and put carefully
away with just the feeling of joy and
thankfulness which Tom had striven
for when he wrote them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT this time, and for some
weeks later, Tom longed continually
to commence a more decided service
for his Master. But there were
several things that came in the way:
First, after his long day’s work in the
fields, his evening writing, although
only for an hour, was very wearying,
and often when he reached the house
at night he could not, from fatigue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
either study or talk with those who
nightly gathered there. Then, too,
he felt that if he should undertake a
regular Sunday-school, it would meet
with opposition from the master, Mr.
Sutherland. He had been very kind
to him so far, and paid him liberally
for his evening work, but Tom had
never seen the little girl since that
first night, and somehow he connected
the little hymn he had taught her and
her absence together. Then his pupils
had no books, and it seemed to him
that whatever other people might do,
he could not teach a Sunday-school
without books. With it all he became
weary and very homesick, longing for
the sight of a familiar face. His face
grew more sober and his step heavier.
He strove against it and tried to feel
thankful, but it was hard indeed, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
although his friends noticed it less
than he imagined, yet Tom was not
happy.</p>

<p>One night, however, the opportunity
for which he had been watching and
waiting so long came to him when he
least expected it. He turned homeward
from his writing on this particular
evening very weary and heartsick.
Had Martha seen him, she would have
known that all was not well with him,
but he knew that he was alone, so he
allowed his despondent feelings full
play.</p>

<p>As he lifted the latch of the door
and heard the voices within, he heaved
a little sigh, wished for an hour’s quiet
study with Martha, and then resolutely
stepped within the room.</p>

<p>There were a number gathered as
usual, and they were very busily talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
about something, yet they all
looked up when Tom came in.</p>

<p>“Ah! here he is now,” some one
remarked.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said one of the men, whose
voice he had heard as he came in,
“we’ve been talking about you. You
see, we’ve come to the conclusion that
you knows a heap more’n the rest of
us, and we’s been studyin’ as to how
maybe you’d be willin’ to teach us a
little of nights, after you gets through
up to the great house.”</p>

<p>“I would very gladly teach you any
time, Uncle Silas,” replied Tom, thinking
that any hold on their hearts was
a gain, “but the trouble here, just as
in another plan of mine, is that we
have no books.”</p>

<p>“But some of us has got books,
honey,” said one old woman, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
we’ll lend ’em to those as has none of
their own. Now there’s eight of us
here to-night, and plenty more that
wants to come. What do you say?”</p>

<p>What do you think he said, reader?
Can you imagine how his face brightened,
or can you hear the heartiness
of his consent to their plan? This
new work, sent him, as he believed, by
God, was entered upon immediately
with a great deep joy and a silent
thanksgiving in his heart. He gave
his first lesson that very night, listening
to the slowly-spelled words of
those who were proud to say they had
commenced to learn, and to the rest
showing the first letters of the alphabet.
He did not confine himself to
these, however, but as he went the
rounds from one to another, he would
lead the talk from some word in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
book to something he had heard or
read elsewhere, putting them in a way,
while they were learning their letters,
to store their minds from his with
many better things.</p>

<p>“Such an opportunity to work for
Jesus!” his heart cried exultingly, and
so when the clock struck nine, as he
told them they had learned enough
for one evening, he added that “he
would like to read to them before they
went.”</p>

<p>They were very well content; so he
opened his Bible and read to them—with
such an interest in the words
himself that the listening was pleasant—the
story of the Good Samaritan;
and then, closing the book, he repeated
it again in words which were
better understood by them, enforcing
the lesson which is among the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
beautiful taught by our Saviour in his
parables: “Go and do thou likewise.”</p>

<p>Then he dismissed them, saying that
on the next evening they should meet
again, and that they might bring as
many of their friends as chose to come.</p>

<p>“My house used to be a place of
frolic, honey,” Aunt Margaret said,
as they went out, “but now it is a
place of education.”</p>

<p>And Tom, happy boy! went up-stairs
and kneeled beside his bed with
his heart full of thanks. They could
not be expressed, but a tear or two
told all he could not say, and Jimmy’s
rather spiteful remark, that “he supposed
he felt too big for anything,”
fell on his ears as lightly as the summer’s
rain upon the moist soil. Although
his head throbbed with the
effort of the day, his field-work in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
burning sun and the double task of
the evening, yet his waking thoughts
were as sweet as his sleep, and <i>that</i>
was most calm and peaceful.</p>

<p>It so happened that, a day or two
after, Mr. Sutherland took him away
from his regular work in the field, and
sent him into the barn to receive the
loads of hay which were being brought
in from the field. Tom was always
glad of these occasional changes, because
they rested him from more
fatiguing work, and often gave him
a few minutes in which to study. He
brought his Bible and his arithmetic
with him when he came out this
morning, and it so happened that
he found leisure to give them attention,
for the field from which the hay
was being brought was at a considerable
distance, and it took some time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
for them to come with the loads.
During one of these leisure times he
had seated himself on the step of the
great door at the back of the barn,
and was intent upon his Bible, when
he heard some child’s voice singing,
and looking up he saw, just coming
into the barn at the other end, Lillie
Sutherland, whom he had not seen
since the first evening he spent at the
house. She saw him just as he looked
up, and stopped both her walk and
her music, and stood looking at him.</p>

<p>She was a pretty little creature to
see, but Tom did not wait for that.</p>

<p>“Miss Lillie, can’t you come here
and see me?” asked he.</p>

<p>She shook her head, but stood still
with her eyes still fixed upon him,
and then suddenly stepped very quickly
forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“Oh, are you the boy that writes
for papa?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Lillie,” replied Tom;
“do you remember me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I do. Sing ‘Jesus loves
me.’”</p>

<p>So Tom, amused at her manner, but
very well content to do as she asked,
sung the hymn through to a very
attentive listener; but to his astonishment,
when he had finished she
asked him the same question as once
before.</p>

<p>“Do you love Jesus?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom—adding quietly,
“do you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she returned; “I cannot
help it, because he is so kind; but
mamma does not like it, nor papa,
very much.”</p>

<p>Tom was not astonished, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
grieved, but he said as calmly as
before, “That makes no difference.”</p>

<p>“Ought I to love Jesus just the
same, and pray to him just the same,
if mamma does not like it?”</p>

<p>“What has Jesus done for you?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“He died for me,” she replied, as
if it were a needless question.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom, with a smile,
turning over the leaves of his Bible,
“he died for you and me.”</p>

<p>“Well, what then?” asked the child,
waiting to see what was coming next,
but getting no word.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Tom, looking up, “I
think when anybody has died for me,
I can never do enough for them if I
work all my life.”</p>

<p>She stood for several minutes after
that, with her eyes away out in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
green fields, and then she said suddenly:</p>

<p>“Does God love you just as well as
he does me, when you are black and I
am white?”</p>

<p>Tom’s lip took a sorrowful curve
for an instant, and then he replied,</p>

<p>“Just as well;” and the words were
very decided.</p>

<p>She gave him another good look out
of her great black eyes, and then seating
herself on the step, she said:</p>

<p>“Read.”</p>

<p>So he opened his Bible and read to
her the story of the crucifixion. It
needed no comment or simpler rendering,
for the story, as it ever does
and ever will, made instant impress on
the heart and mind of the listener.
Did you ever try to imagine what the
feelings of the apostles must have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
been when they wrote those four
sublime gospels? What a work of
intermingled joy and pain it must
have been!</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Lillie,” said Tom,
when he had finished, “if you can
read, I want you to go home and read
this over for yourself, and then think
whom you ought to love.”</p>

<p>“What shall I do then?” asked
the child, as if she already surmised
the result of the reading.</p>

<p>“Remember this one verse, and if
I ever see you again, I shall ask you
whether you have done as it commands:
‘If God so loved us, we ought
also to love one another.’”</p>

<p>She repeated it two or three times
after him, and then stood quietly until
the sound of voices reached her;
and then, with one quick glance in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
direction from which they came, she
sprang through the door, out across
the yard toward the back of the house.
Up through the front gate in the opposite
direction came the great load,
and Tom received the hay, standing in
the upper loft of the barn.</p>

<p>And so it was that, after thinking
over the interview, and sorrowing that
the religion he loved was to some
hedged about with so many difficulties,
when he gathered his class about
him that night, and looked around
upon them, feeling that he need not
be afraid to speak for Jesus here,
he felt most devoutly thankful in his
heart for the liberty which is ours
when Christ has made us free.</p>

<p>The interest manifested by his pupils
was wonderful. Old gray-headed men
bent over their spelling-books and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
tried hard to decipher the words, looking
up into the youthful face that
watched them as to one above themselves,
because to him had been
granted a privilege which was not
theirs. As the days advanced this
did not lessen in the least; if anything,
it seemed to increase. It was
a beautiful thing to see, and to any
one who felt an interest in the welfare
of these neglected souls a peep into
this tiny school-room was worth going
far to see. Tom often wished
Miss Mason could be there. He tried
to say as little in his home letters
about his own connection with it as
he well could, but he knew not what
a happy sense of duty done they contained
in those days. His teacher
used to read them over, and say it
was sweet refreshment in her weary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
work—this boy’s good service for his
Lord, and the utter simplicity and
yet full gladness with which he wrote
of it.</p>

<p>It was joy, yet the letters home
were the best part of it. There were
hours abroad and at home when the
work was all done—house, field, and
school tasks all completed—when the
pressure on Tom’s mind seemed more
than he could bear. That which lay
heaviest was the care he felt over
these souls who for five or six hours
every week were committed to his
care. Teach them he did, well and
faithfully, but it was the work for
Jesus which he was in constant fear
that he should neglect. He grew so
morbid over it that whenever he
heard a man in the field swear or
speak wrongly, he always questioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
whether if he, Tom, had done his duty
this would have happened. His success
was far beyond his knowledge.
He was so constantly in the habit of
dropping a word for Jesus, because
“out of the abundance of his heart
his mouth spake,” that the people
learned to expect that when they
came to him in odd minutes for assistance
in their tasks, there would
be a word of holy cheer given them
before they went away. They learned
to have a strange reverence for this
boy. It was some little time before
Tom discovered that Mr. Sutherland
knew of all this, but the master had
heard the boy’s name in so many
directions that at length he became
interested to know how far his popularity
extended. A few inquiries
gave him all he wanted—enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
astonish him at any rate—and then
Tom heard of it.</p>

<p>One day at noon Tom stood in the
field, leaning against the branch of a
tree, resting himself and softly singing,
when up came one of his evening
scholars with an appeal for help.</p>

<p>“I knowed you knowed,” he said,
apologetically, “so I brought it to find
out.”</p>

<p>Tom took it with a little weary sigh,
which he did not allow to reach his lips,
and gave the required help. As he
handed back the book he asked, with
a smile,</p>

<p>“How are you getting on now, Uncle
Gilbert?”</p>

<p>“Only toler’ble, Tom,” he returned;
“old feller’s aches and pains right
smart bad sometimes.”</p>

<p>“The Lord Jesus will take the pain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
away, because you will not feel it
when you are bearing it for him.
Have you asked him, uncle?”</p>

<p>“I reckon, Tom, the Lord thinks
old Gil no ’count.”</p>

<p>“You are as useful as I am, Uncle
Gilbert, and I once asked God for
patience, and he gave me enough to
last me through a long illness. Look
to him, uncle.”</p>

<p>So Uncle Gilbert went away, and
after a few minutes’ very grave thought,
Tom turned around to take up his hoe
and found his master at his elbow.
His hand was at his cap in an instant.</p>

<p>“You do your teaching at all hours
of the day, Tom?” he said, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, they are anxious to learn,”
replied Tom; and then, gathering courage,
he added, “I have been wanting
to ask you for a long time whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
you had any objection to the school
which I hold every evening at Aunt
Margaret’s.”</p>

<p>“No, not in the least,” replied Mr.
Sutherland, “although I must say I
was surprised to find that you had
undertaken it, when I knew you had
your hands full already.”</p>

<p>“They wanted, sir, and I knew how
I used to want when I could not have.
I could not refuse.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes think,” said Mr. Sutherland
slowly, with his eyes on his
fingers, which were chipping off pieces
of bark from the tree against which
Tom leaned—“I sometimes think that
we are just beginning to understand
your people.”</p>

<p>He got a very deep look out of
the dark eyes in reply, but that was
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I came over here,” he continued
after a moment, “to say to you that I
think you had better leave your field-work
altogether, and devote your days
to my books and your evenings to
your school. You are doing too
much.”</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes sparkled for a moment,
but then he returned gravely, “I
know it, sir, but I think with your
leave I will still keep on. Martha—my
sister—writes me that work is
hard to get, and they will need my
earnings.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall continue your wages
just the same,” said Mr. Sutherland
hastily. “It is for my interest to do
so. I shall need you longer now, as
the returns begin to come in.”</p>

<p>“Then, sir, I would gladly come,”
replied Tom joyfully, “and thank you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
very much. My work is very wearying
sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is all then. Come up
as usual to-night—I shall want you.
Good-morning.”</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” replied Tom,
and after watching his master until he
disappeared, he clasped his hands and
looked upward, with every particle of
pain and weariness banished from his
face. “He knoweth them that trust
in him,” he thought.</p>

<p>His letter to Martha that night
carried joy with it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER the commencement of Tom’s
evening-school, and before he gave
up his field-work, his time was so fully
occupied that when the labors of the
day were over, he often felt so very
weary that he had almost given up
the thought of his Sunday-school; and
when it did occur to him in his longing
to do more Christian work, he
knew very well that he had not leisure
enough to devote to any such thing.
Now, however, as soon as he was installed
in the master’s house, to spend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
five or six hours every day with his
books, in the leisure hours which
came to him, the thought of the
Sunday-school recurred to him constantly.
Still, he dreaded to undertake
this task. He felt how very
young he was, and saw dimly what an
undertaking it would be. It was quite
a long time therefore before he took
any active steps in the matter, and
then it was through a letter from Miss
Mason. She had known a little, from
what Tom had written, of how the boy
was progressing; and although long
ago he had told her of his anxiety to
commence a Sunday-school, she had
never heard more of it, and of late his
letters were written in a half-desponding
tone, which she could not feel easy
about; so she wrote him a letter which,
without mentioning the subject, gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
him just what he wanted to think
about.</p>

<p>“The Lord’s work needs hands
always,” she wrote. “I took up a book
the other day when I was feeling
rather listless and inclined to remain
at home, and I had not read two
verses of a hymn upon which my
eyes fell before I laid it down, put on
my bonnet and went out to visit my
scholars. Isn’t there some work for
you, Tom, among all those people?
Suppose you remember the two verses
I read, and if they affect you as they
did me, it will not be long before the
Lord’s work comes ready at your
hands.”</p>

<p>“I was feeling just in the mood that
the first verse expresses, Tom, but the
second verse sent me out. Can we
do too much for Him who said, ‘the
fields are white unto the harvest,’
and who told us through his blessed
apostle John, ‘Let him that heareth

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Tom drank in every word of this
letter as one who was athirst, and he
had just put it away the morning after
its reception, after a third reading, and
was bending over his writing, when
Mr. Sutherland came in and sat down
to read the newspaper. Tom’s pen
moved more slowly. He glanced frequently
from his task to Mr. Sutherland,
and once or twice held his pen
above the paper, watching him as
though he wished to speak, and finally,
when Mr. Sutherland laid down
his reading, Tom lifted his head
and spoke—very faintly, indeed, at
first:</p>

<p>“Mr. Sutherland, I wanted to ask
a favor of you.”</p>

<p>“Well, Tom, be in a hurry; I must
get over to the other plantation.”</p>

<p>This was not very cheering, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
after the first effort he gained fresh
courage:</p>

<p>“I have long been wishing to start
a Sunday-school among the people,
Mr. Sutherland. Have you any objection
to my undertaking it?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t one school enough for you,
Tom?” asked Mr. Sutherland, a little
gruffly.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he replied, with a little
smile—“not while I can do more
good.”</p>

<p>“There is no place to hold a Sunday-school,”
objected the master.</p>

<p>“There is an empty log-cabin out
beyond the quarters, which would do
very well in warm weather.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose you will shout
and make a great noise about it.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, indeed,” urged Tom; “it
will be as quiet as white people’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
schools—as near like the one I have
been attending all the year as I can
possibly make it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” returned Mr. Sutherland,
“I don’t know that I care much; but
mind, if there is any disturbance I
will put an end to it at short notice.”</p>

<p>Tom thanked him with a face full
of pleasure, and returned to his work
with a glad heart.</p>

<p>That evening, just after his work at
the house was finished, and just before
school-time, he went down to the
quarters and visited the people. With
a great deal of timidity and faint-heartedness
he knocked at the first
cabin door, but it was here his round
of joy began. He used in years after
to look back upon the pretty twilight
walk with utter joy, and never without
a fresh desire in his heart to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
for that Lord who always gives the
wherewithal when we have the spirit.</p>

<p>“It’s Tom Alson,” said the little
child who opened the first cabin door,
and Tom heard his welcome from
within:</p>

<p>“Come in, Tom, here’s supper just
ready,” said Aunt Polly’s voice, “and
you must have somethin’, sure. It’s
a fine ev’nin’, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Beautiful, Aunt Polly, but I must
not stop. We are going to have a
Sunday-school in the log-house behind
the quarters Sunday afternoon,
and I came to find out whether you
would come.”</p>

<p>“Is you gwine to be thar?” asked
she.</p>

<p>“Certainly, Aunt Polly.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll come, sure. Bring the
chil’ens, did you say? I reckon I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
will if you want them. Why, do you
know Polly and Becky?” for the children
had given Tom a very glad
greeting.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, I know them,” he replied;
“we are quite old friends. Now I
must go; good-bye.”</p>

<p>And so on to the next house, and
the next, and the next—everywhere a
warm greeting and a petition that he
would stay; everywhere the children
ran, for Tom had in no way neglected
to make their acquaintance long ago,
thinking always that he might leave
with them of the sweet Bible words
on which he lived. His heart grew
bigger and bigger with thankful delight
and pleasure as his list swelled.
Two or three places he was obliged to
stop to explain the evening lesson or
read a few words, so that when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
reached the step of Aunt Margaret’s
cabin it was almost dark. To any
but Tom the experience of the afternoon
might have brought a little feeling
of his own importance and the respect
in which these people held him,
but there was nothing of that—only a
devout thankfulness and a longing to
have Martha with him to share his
joy.</p>

<p>But more than ever he longed for
the help which he knew she could
give when he called his little Sunday-school
together on Sunday afternoon.
His face did not show what he felt,
but it was only with the help of a fervent
prayer that he brought himself
there at all. When he opened his little
Bible to read, there were thirty
faces looking toward him—men, women
and children of every age. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
each brought a chair or a stool with
them, and sitting around the sides
of the cabin, some leaning back and
others erect, they all gave the most
careful and fixed attention to the voice,
manner and words of the reader. As
for Tom, with a trembling heart, he
opened his Bible and began. He had
chosen one of the Psalms, and as the
words of trust, and refuge, and sure
strength have come home to tired
hearts ever since the words were first
given, so they came home to Tom’s
heart, and made him “strong in the
Lord of hosts.”</p>

<p>The prayer that followed was our
Saviour’s own, and oh how much better
it made Tom feel! They sang after
that one of their own hymns, and the
words given in their full, rich voices,
with all the pathos belonging peculiarly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
to the race, stilled more hearts
than one.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“There’s no more rain to wet you,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh yes! I want to go home—want to go home;</div>

<div class="indent2">All is gladness in de kingdom,</div>
<div class="verse">Oh yes! I want to go home—want to go home.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>After they had finished, Tom talked
to them a while from some sweet Bible
words. Oh how humble, how unfit
he felt that he should be the one to
lead them home! It was only his love
for Christ that brought the words
forth at all, but that, stirring his soul,
sent that which was sweet to hear.
As for those who listened, it was nothing
new to them. All that was
strange was that he should talk to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
them all at once, but there was not
one there who had not heard the name
of Jesus from the boy’s lips before.
They all knew how sweetly it came,
or they would not have been here to-day.
“When young Tom talks religion,
I can listen,” said one old man.
“He talks sense, and he is brimming
over with God’s love.” That was the
secret of his success everywhere.</p>

<p>Just as he had finished his little
talk he looked up, and through the
doorway he could see Mr. Sutherland
walking quietly down the road toward
the building. It confused him for a
minute, but then, regaining his composure,
he asked them to sing again;
so when Mr. Sutherland came in the
wild notes of another hymn were being
thrown out on the sweet summer
afternoon air. The master stopped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
just within the door and stood still to
listen. When they ceased singing,
Tom asked them if they remembered
any texts which they could repeat.
There was a moment’s hesitation, and
then one said:</p>

<p>“Men ought always to pray and not
to faint.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom, with a smile,
“if people pray they will not faint.
Are there any more?”</p>

<p>There were plenty more. It only
needed some one to commence. One
followed another, and their memories
seemed stored with sweet words of
rest and hope. Minds which could
not grasp many a simpler thing of
every-day life, rested and dwelt upon
the divine words, and understood
them because they <i>were</i> divine.</p>

<p>When they had finished Tom looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
round toward Mr. Sutherland with a
little smile of triumph, but there was
no response there. He stood with his
hat pushed back off his forehead, and
one hand thrust negligently into his
pocket, leaning against the door-post.
His eyes were on the floor, but somehow
Tom knew they had not been
fixed there for the past fifteen minutes.
Nevertheless, he turned back a little
disappointed.</p>

<p>“I think it is time to close now,”
he said. “We have no books or we
would have a short lesson, but if you
like to come next Sunday we will be
glad to see you all. Now let us put
ourselves in God’s hands, and then go
home.”</p>

<p>So Tom kneeled by the little rush-bottomed
chair he had brought from
Aunt Margaret’s cabin, and gave his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
school into God’s keeping for the week,
praying that the words they had heard
to-day might stay by them always,
and help them in all they did to work
for God’s glory.</p>

<p>Then Tom arose, just in time to see
Mr. Sutherland standing erect in the
doorway, his hat in his hand and his
head bent in the attitude of prayer.
Tom’s heart gave one throb of joy.
There were others that saw it besides
himself, he knew, and it was all he
wanted to impress the lesson of the
afternoon. What a blessed Sunday
evening that was! I think Tom never
spent such another. The Sunday-school
grew and prospered ever after
that, and the Sunday evenings were
always pleasant, but never one like
this. It was a stand taken, a point
gained; begun thus in God’s strength,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
it was sure to succeed. Tom was very
grateful.</p>

<p>After supper, he sat on the step
of Aunt Margaret’s cabin, letting the
full moonlight pour over him, and
longing for Martha’s presence that he
might talk over the precious afternoon
with her. Whilst he thus sat
and mused two or three children
approached him from the quarters,
and stopping near him, one of them
timidly asked him,</p>

<p>“If you please Tom, could you
teach us a text for next Sunday? We
want to recite something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes.” Tom was willing,
so they sat down on the step below
him, and each one was given a text.</p>

<p>“Love one another with a pure
heart fervently.” That was the first.</p>

<p>“God resisteth the proud and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
giveth grace unto the humble.” That
was the second.</p>

<p>The third—which Tom gave to the
eldest of the three, who sat looking
up earnestly at him, waiting for his
words—was one whose glorious words
had been pouring their light through
Tom’s soul ever since the afternoon
school—his triumph in Christ’s name:</p>

<p>“This is the victory that overcometh
the world, even our faith.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was one part of Tom’s
Sunday-school and evening-school
work which I think he never took
into consideration when he was
endeavoring to calculate, as he was
very fond of doing, the extent of its
influence and the number of people
to whom it had been the means of
doing good. I say, I think he never
discovered the amount of good it did
to two loving hearts at home—Miss
Mason and Martha. After the commencement
of his evening-school, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
had written every week, either to his
sister or his teacher, and when the
modestly written accounts were read
by those for whom they were written,
it did them a world of good.</p>

<p>“Brother Tom is doing so much,
Miss Mason,” said Martha, one day,
as she stood by Miss Mason’s sitting-room
fire, with Tom’s last letter in her
hand, “I feel as if I was not doing
anything.”</p>

<p>“We must just sit still and be thankful,
until our work comes, Martha,”
replied Miss Mason. “God will send
it to us if we ask him. You had part
of yours when Tom was sick, and this
that he is doing is only an outgrowth
from that.”</p>

<p>“This that Tom was doing” was a
great deal. No one who saw him
bending over Mr. Sutherland’s books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
hour after hour, copying the roughly-written
accounts, would have imagined
that his name was spoken everywhere
over the plantation with praise and
love. A very modest-looking colored
boy he was, plain of face, with only
those dark, earnest eyes to make him
beautiful. A grave mouth, not much
given to smiling, but which never
wore any look of discontent or distrust.
Hands used to work, but grown
tender of late when the work had
been only the long hours of writing.
His feet were bare; there was no need
of shoes and stockings, and there was
no inclination for them, for Tom’s
money went to buy what was needed
at home; so they rested on the soft
carpet of the library and the carpetless
floor of Aunt Margaret’s cabin
alike. To a stranger going into Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
Sutherland’s house of a morning, and
watching the still figure at the desk
in the library, the contrast between
the boy and his surroundings would
have been striking. There was nothing
fine or stylish about Tom. His
dress was very plain, whole and neat,
but coarse and ordinary. There was
nothing elegant about him, yet all
things around him were so.</p>

<p>You remember I told you about the
library. There was everything there
that money could buy and taste devise.
Mr. Sutherland had taken this
room for himself and Tom, soon after
the boy had commenced to spend his
time there, and they two were the
only ones who occupied it. Not one
bit of the prettiness was lost upon
Tom. The little education he had received
had fitted him, as education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
fits everybody, to admire and appreciate
all that is worthy of praise.
Tom liked the velvet library chairs
better than the wooden ones at home;
he preferred the hanging scarlet curtains
to none at all; and he even chose
rather to see the time by the French
clock on the walnut bracket than by
Aunt Margaret’s ancient time-piece.</p>

<p>He never showed this outside. He
only thought it to himself, and he
never felt out of place in the library.
Nobody who knew him well thought
so either. He seemed a part of the
library to Mr. Sutherland, and in no
way a contrast to any of the surroundings.
The house-servants had learned
to have a wonderful respect for him.
Occasionally he had been obliged to
ask of them some little service, and
with considerable timidity he had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
so, but he was always served with the
utmost willingness and pleasure.</p>

<p>The first time he ever ventured
this was one wet morning in August.
Mr. Sutherland always ordered a fire
when there was a rain-storm, even in
the close, warm days of summer, and
on this particular day he was expected
home about ten o’clock, and had ordered
a fire to be in readiness. The
order, however, was forgotten, and
when Tom came in to his morning’s
work it was cold and cheerless, and
the heavy summer rain was beating
against the windows. Tom knew
there would be trouble if Mr. Sutherland
came home and found it so, but,
on the other hand, he thought there
might be more trouble if he were to
go into the kitchen and order a fire
made. He thought of it several minutes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and then, coming to the conclusion
that it would better to stand the
fire of Aunt Dinah’s anger than Mr.
Sutherland’s, he quietly betook himself
across the wide hall and appeared
at the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Laws! here’s Tom,” said Aunt
Dinah, stopping her work to look at
him. “What brings you here?” she
added.</p>

<p>“Aunt Dinah,” he replied, “I’m
sorry to trouble you, but there is no
fire in the library, and Mr. Sutherland
ordered one before he went away
this morning. If you will be kind
enough to give me the wood, I’ll make
one, for I think Mr. Sutherland will
be better pleased to find a cheerful
room when he comes back.”</p>

<p>“Tom, you just turn round and go
back to your writing,” said Aunt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Dinah, indignantly. “I’m sorry as
ever I can be that there’s no fire, but
I’ll have one there in five minutes.
I don’t know what these niggers
means by disobeyin’ my orders.
Here, you Jack!” she called out,
catching sight of the youngest of her
flock, “why didn’t you make the
library fire? Here’s Tom got no fire
to write by, and he your Sunday-school
teacher, too. Ain’t you ’shamed
of yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Dinah, I don’t care for
myself,” Tom replied. “Give me the
wood and I’ll make it.”</p>

<p>“What do you ’spose Master Sutherland
do to this chile if she let you
make the fire? Go ’long with you
and set your pen to scratchin’, and in
five minutes there be a blaze goin’ up
that chimney fit to take the roof off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>So Tom obeyed, and in less than
the time she mentioned a little boy
was kneeling in front of the grate,
softly laying in the pieces of wood,
and Tom heard Aunt Dinah tell him,
as a last word as she opened the
library door to admit him,</p>

<p>“Now, you Jack, whatever you do,
don’t ’sturb Tom’s writin’.”</p>

<p>One morning, some time later than
this, Tom was occupied over his morning’s
work, writing away very busily,
when he heard the door open softly
and then close again. He was sitting
with his back to it, so he did not look
around, but went on with his task.
Presently, however, lifting his head
and hand together to move some
papers, he found standing by his side,
with motionless eyes fixed upon his
face, Lillie Sutherland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>“Good-morning, Miss Lillie,” said
Tom, respectfully. “I did not know
you were there, or I would have
spoken before.”</p>

<p>“Papa said,” returned the child,
“that I might come in and see you if
I could be very still and not speak to
you until you were ready.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am ready now,” replied
Tom; “only first let me get you a
chair.” So he rose and with a gentle
courtesy placed a low-seated rocking-chair
near his table and asked
her to be seated.</p>

<p>She watched him bring it, and then
seated herself with the utmost satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I came,” she said with an important
air, which sat very curiously on
her little figure, “to ask you if I might
come to your Sunday-school.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Tom was very much surprised. “I
am afraid your father would not like
it, Miss Lillie,” he said, gently.</p>

<p>“But papa said I might, and mamma
said she did not care,” urged Lillie.</p>

<p>“I am sure I’ll be glad to see you,
Miss Lillie, but are you sure you
would like it? There is no one there
but the people from the quarters.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but you talk about
Jesus, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes!” replied Tom, the little
smile hovering about his lips which
always came at any loving mention of
his Saviour’s name.</p>

<p>“Well, then, that’s just what I want
to come for. I never hear anything
about Jesus at home. And besides,
he is there with you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Tom, earnestly—“yes
indeed, Miss Lillie. I was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
wrong to forget that. I shall be very
glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Tom; then I will come,
but I want something more. Jake says
the children learn verses to say—hymns
or Bible verses. Won’t you
teach me one? I know a good many
old ones, but I want something quite
new for the first Sunday.”</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes fell for a moment, and a
curious look flashed from them into
the roses on the carpet. It was of
gladness that he knew just what she
wanted and could give it to her—of
sorrow that more about him did not
know, and a mingling of both joy and
sorrow that she, the daughter of the
house, should be obliged to come to
him, a laborer on the plantation, for
the knowledge of Jesus.</p>

<p>But when his words came, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
showed none of his thought, except a
realization of who it was to whom he
was speaking:</p>

<p>“I think, Miss Lillie, I can give you
a very pretty little verse I learned a
few days ago. Will you stay a few
minutes longer and learn it?”</p>

<p>“Yes indeed,” she replied, “I will
stay.”</p>

<p>So line by line, in the same simple
way he had given the Bible verses to
the children on Sunday, he taught her
the four lines he had selected. She
learned them very soon and then rose
to go. Tom rose too, and opened the
door for her.</p>

<p>“If you please, Miss Lillie,” he said
as he dismissed her, “send one of the
children down to the cabin with a
chair on Sunday. We all bring our
own seats.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Tom did not forget his new scholar
between that morning and the following
Sunday afternoon. He thought
of her many times, and was very glad
that she was coming; nevertheless it
was with a mingled feeling of pleasure
and embarrassment that he saw the
little green velvet chair standing close
to his own when he came into the
cabin on Sunday afternoon. The
people were evidently very curious
about it, and divided their glances
between Tom’s face and the pretty
seat. The greater part of them
thought it was for him, but he took
his own chair, and left them still in
doubt. Tom waited for Lillie a little
beyond his time, so that when the
child appeared at length in the doorway
there were a number of eyes
watching her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>She brought herself in her little
embroidered dress down through the
midst of them, and seated herself in
the chair, and the two fitted each other
so exactly as to leave no doubt as to
the person for whom it had been placed
there.</p>

<p>Then Tom commenced his school in
his usual way, without the least want
of composure, although he felt his
position not a little. He had perfect
attention. Lillie’s dress attracted two
or three pair of bright eyes, but no
more; the teacher’s words were too good
to be lost.</p>

<p>There were a number of verses given
this afternoon, but each one was rewarded
with a word of praise from
Tom. He had learned his position.
Outside he might be, and was, one of
them, but here he was undoubtedly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>their teacher, and no one ever attempted
to gainsay his authority inside
his Sunday-school room.</p>

<p>“Would you like to say your verse,
Miss Lillie?” he said at length, turning
to her as the others finished.</p>

<p>“Certainly I should,” she replied.
“I learned it perfectly.”</p>

<p>So she rose and stood beside her
chair, with one hand resting on its
carved back, and recited with an earnestness
caught in part from the way
which Tom had given her the words—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“He prayeth best who loveth best,</div>
<div class="indent">All things both great and small;</div>
<div class="verse">For the dear God who loveth us,</div>
<div class="indent">He made and loveth all.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>There was a low laugh of admiration
went all around the room when
she finished, and Tom with a pleased
smile said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“That was very nicely done.”</p>

<p>Then, with the usual prayer for help
and guidance, he dismissed them, and
then offered to take Miss Lillie’s chair
up to the house for her.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied, carelessly, “let
it stand; I will send Jack for it.”</p>

<p>So he did as she requested, and
took his way toward the quarters.
Miss Lillie, however, kept up with
him, talking and asking questions
about the Sunday-school. Tom, however,
seemed absent-minded, and finally
stopped short in the path.</p>

<p>“Miss Lillie, I wish you would let
me go back after that chair,” he said.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, I don’t care if you
want to,” she replied, in a surprised
tone, “but Jack can come just as well.”</p>

<p>Tom would not listen, but ran to
the school-room, took the chair, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
came back to where Lillie was standing,
bearing it on his shoulder.</p>

<p>So they walked up through the
quarters beside all the cabin doors, at
which the people were gathered and
watching; on up to the house, on the
piazza of which Tom put down his
burden, and touching his cap bade
Miss Lillie “good-afternoon,” and
walked away.</p>

<p>He knew exactly what he had done,
and why he had done it. When he
had found that Miss Lillie intended
coming up with him through the
quarters, he knew that among the
people, even those that loved Tom
best, there would arise a jealousy that
Miss Lillie should notice one more
than another. The beginning of this
he had seen before, and for fear his
influence with them might be lessened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
in the slightest degree, he did the
very thing which set it all at rest immediately.
And so, as they stood at
their doors and watched the two go
by, it seemed just as it should be to
them. Tom, as Lillie’s servant, bore
her chair. It satisfied them entirely,
and Tom gained rather than lost in
their opinion.</p>

<p>Now, do my young readers understand
what I am talking about. Tom
felt not one whit above his fellow-servants,
but for fear they should think
he did, and so the religion he was trying
to spread should be hindered, he
wished to carry Miss Lillie’s chair.
And let me tell you it was an honor
to him, for it was what St. Paul meant
when he said: “Let not your good
be evil spoken of.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">LILLIE’S first Sunday at the school
was the commencement of a very
strange friendship which grew up between
herself and Tom. She never
entered the library, except when especially
sent by her father, but she
was always waiting at the door when
Tom came out, and walked with him
as far as the cabin door. Tom was
afraid at first that Mr. Sutherland
would object, but finding one day,
from some chance word he dropped,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
that he knew of it and had no objection,
Tom began to take great pleasure
in Lillie’s company. He thought,
too, that young as she was, if she once
became interested in the people, she
might learn to do good among them
after he had gone away. So he often
took her with him to the quarters
during his visits to the people. It
grew to be such a common custom to
see them together about the grounds
that the people forgot to be jealous,
and her gentle bearing pleased them.
She never said much, but listened attentively
to all that went on, only
once in a while putting in a question.
Simple and child-like, she never
seemed to remember the difference
in position between herself and the
people; and they, finding they were
looked upon as equals, learned to love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
her. Tom was quick to see this, and
take advantage of it, to interest Lillie
in every way in his power in the Sunday-school
and the people. Mr. Sutherland
saw it and shut his eyes to it,
taking care that no rumor of it should
reach his wife.</p>

<p>All this was quite encouraging to
Tom, and he grew happy in the long
summer days. There was one thing,
however, he very much wished for,
but which seemed beyond his reach.
This was the friendship of his school-mate,
Jimmy. He seemed opposed to
all Tom’s movements—not in any active
way, but he shunned him on all
occasions, and never came near the
Sunday-school. Miss Mason often
sent messages to him, and Tom always
took great pains to deliver them,
sometimes showing him where she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
had mentioned him in the letter. But
although the messages were received
with evident pleasure, the messenger
was not, and Tom often went away
sorrowful. He could not see that
Jimmy took an interest in anything.
He always went to bed when the
evening-school assembled, and did his
work mechanically. Yet his words
and actions in Tom’s presence seemed
always under restraint.</p>

<p>Therefore, Tom was very much surprised
one morning, as he came from
the library, to meet Jimmy at the foot
of the steps, evidently waiting to
speak with him.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he said, excitedly, “there’s
a bundle come for you by the cars
this morning, and I should not in the
least wonder if it should be books for
the Sunday-school. There’s a letter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
too, for I heard master say so. Perhaps
it’s from Miss Mason.”</p>

<p>Tom was pleased with the news,
and more than pleased with Jimmy’s
interest. He made the most of it,
immediately.</p>

<p>“Why, Jimmy, that’s splendid!”
he said, his dark eyes sparkling.
“Come and show me where I can
find it.”</p>

<p>So Jimmy, nothing loth, started
with Tom, and brought him round
the corner of the house to where the
wagon from the station was just depositing
its load.</p>

<p>“Ah, Tom,” said Mr. Sutherland as
he came up, “I was just about sending
for you. You are getting to be
of considerable importance. There’s
a great heavy bundle addressed to you,
which came by express this morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
and here I have a letter which appears
to belong to it.”</p>

<p>“It’s books, Tom, I know,” said
Jimmy, pounding the bundle with his
hand; “unfasten it, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” replied Tom,
“until I see what Miss Mason says.”</p>

<p>So carefully cutting the end of the
envelope (Miss Mason’s letters were
never roughly handled), he drew the
letter out and glanced over the contents.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” he said, as he finished
and turned toward the boy with a very
touched face, “I think you must read
this letter to pay you for bringing me
such good news.” So he gave him
the precious words.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew what a treat that was,
and that there was not another person
on the place to whom Tom would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
shown it, so he thanked him earnestly
as he took it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear Tom,” she wrote, “I am
about sending you a bundle of books
for your Sunday-school; so I thought
I would forward a letter with them,
for fear you would be too much surprised.
I wrote, not long ago, to some
of my Northern friends, and among
other things I told them of your work
for Jesus on the Sutherland Plantation.
In answer to my letter the books
I send you came. How gladly I forward
them you can easily imagine. I
have been thinking for a long time
how much you needed them, and how I
should like to send you a bundle.
Well, here they are then, and I feel
sure you will not forget to thank
‘the Giver of every good and perfect
gift,’ for it is he who sent them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“I opened the bundle to put in two
or three lesson-books, and I have
marked in the arithmetic and grammar
the lessons of your class for the
next month. I hope Jimmy is well,
and that your work is progressing.
Martha says, ‘Oh, Miss Mason, I am
so glad for Tom!’ and I can tell you
there is another one who is glad, and
that is Tom’s old teacher,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">R. Mason</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“Now, Jimmy,” said Tom as the
boy finished and handed him back
the letter with a pleased smile, “come
with me and we will unpack it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t want me, Tom, I am
sure,” replied Jimmy, holding back
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t want my old school-mate to
help me unpack Miss Mason’s present!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
Of course I do! Come, I am in a
hurry to see those precious books.”</p>

<p>So the bundle was carried into the
cabin, and, much to Aunt Margaret’s
satisfaction, was unpacked there in
the main room. Ah! how nice the
books looked! Bibles and Testaments
in plenty to the delight of Tom’s
heart—illuminated texts for the school-room,
little picture cards, the preciousness
of which every Sunday-school
teacher knows. A quantity of penny
hymn-books, and little tracts for distribution,
and then a nice pile—just
twenty—of well-selected library-books.
Tom was perfectly happy. There was
a little package at the bottom directed
to himself in Miss Mason’s hand, and
in this he found a new arithmetic and
grammar, with the places marked, a
parcel of pure white paper and envelopes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
with pens and holder, and a
very pretty Bible Dictionary. Tom’s
eyes were full of joyful tears. He had
been thanking God all the time, and
he only wondered how he should
rightly express to Miss Mason his
gratitude for the gift. Jimmy was in
an ecstasy. His old taste for books
and study woke right up, and he was
Tom’s friend from that minute.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking a long time
about coming to the school, Tom,” he
said, “and of being friends again, but
somehow I didn’t know how to get
about it, after having been out with
you so long. But now I can’t help it;
I must come.”</p>

<p>Late that afternoon Tom came up
toward the mansion, and seeing Mr.
Sutherland and Lillie on the porch, he
walked toward them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Mr. Sutherland,” he said, rather
timidly, “if you feel any interest, I
would like very much to have you
come and see the books sent to the
Sunday-school this morning. I think
it is a very nice collection.”</p>

<p>“I should be very glad to do so,
Tom,” said Mr. Sutherland, good-naturedly,
rising and coming down
off the steps; “I will go with you
now; are they down at Aunt Margaret’s?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Tom, and then as
they stepped away, Tom, looking back,
saw Lillie still sitting in her low
chair upon the piazza. “Miss Lillie,”
he said, stepping back, “won’t you
come too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” she replied, springing
up; “I was only afraid you did not
want me. Wait a minute, papa,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
she added, “until I get my hat from
the stand in the hall.”</p>

<p>“Stay here, Miss Lillie,” said Tom,
checking her and disappearing within
the doorway. He returned in a
moment with the hat, which he gave
her with a little bright smile.</p>

<p>“You are quite a courtier,” said
Mr. Sutherland with an amused face,
as Tom joined him. “Lillie should
wait upon herself sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Miss Lillie does more for me, by
her influence among my scholars, than
I can ever do for her in this way;
and besides,” he added, “I am very
glad to serve her in any way that I
can.”</p>

<p>The books, and the manner of sending
them, were a puzzle to Mr. Sutherland.
He could make nothing of
it. But with the wisdom of the selection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
and the value of the books he
was fully acquainted, and praised them
to Tom’s fullest satisfaction. Lillie
lost herself among the picture cards,
and would hardly be aroused when
her father, after a long examination
of Tom’s treasures, asked her if she
was not ready to go.</p>

<p>But she had leave to look a while
longer, for the people, returning from
the field, having heard—for the news
flew—of the arrival of the books, all
stopped at Aunt Margaret’s cabin on
their way home, to have a peep at
them. Mr. Sutherland stayed to look
and listen, for their interest and excitement
were a marvel to him.</p>

<p>“If Tom can read all these, he must
be mighty learned,” said one of the
women, touching them with the tips
of her fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Not very, auntie,” replied Tom,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Won’t we feel big,” said another,
“when we gets all these shining words
hangin’ round that cabin?”</p>

<p>“I expect we will,” Tom replied,
“but we will feel a great deal more
proud when we get the shining words
so stamped on our hearts that we can
never get them out.”</p>

<p>All this was a leaf in the history of
these people that Mr. Sutherland had
never before taken the trouble to turn
over; and now that it lay open before
him, he was both puzzled and surprised.
By and by, however, he took
Lillie’s hand, and as he turned to go
back to the house, he said to Tom,
“By the way, I wish you would walk
over with us. I find there are some
accounts which arrived this morning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
which require some explanation before
they are copied, and I am going away
early in the morning.”</p>

<p>So Tom, hastily putting aside the
precious books, took his way back with
them. Midway between the cabin
and the house the workmen of the
place were engaged in putting up a
store-house, which was to be in readiness
for the gathering in of the cotton
crop. The men at work were unskilled
in their task, and had caused
Mr. Sutherland much anxiety by the
clumsy way in which they were rearing
the building. Just as he came
opposite them this afternoon, they
were raising a heavy beam by means
of ropes and pulleys, with a great
deal of noise and very little work.
Mr. Sutherland, with an exclamation
of impatience, stopped his words and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
his walk, and came up to where they
were at work—the two, Tom and Lillie,
following.</p>

<p>He spoke to the workmen rather
severely for a few moments, and then
stopped to direct the work. His two
companions, interested in the raising
of the beam, stood under the shadow
of the unfinished part, watching.</p>

<p>Mr. Sutherland stood just outside
giving orders, and the beam was
slowly finding its way to the top,
when there was a sudden strain of the
ropes, and they cracked and parted.</p>

<p>Tom saw what was coming just in
time to seize Lillie, who was standing
beside him, and throw her violently
from him out into the green grass
of the lawn, and then the heavy timber
had fallen into the house, crushing
in the part already finished, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
with it the boy who stood under its
shadow.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” said Lillie, standing on
her feet in the long green grass, and
half crying, “Tom hurt me so bad.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said her father in reply.
“Go home to your mother. Tom is
under those ruins.”</p>

<p>It was with a very white face that
he gave quick directions that the timbers
should be removed, and Lillie, as
soon as she saw what had happened,
never moved. The news spread
like lightning, and a group of pained,
grave faces soon gathered round the
crushed building, to see if possible
whether the human body covered with
the fearful weight had still life within
it.</p>

<p>When at length they lifted Tom from
the ruins, he was found to be wounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
and bruised terribly, but there was life
still there, for the heart was beating.
With a tinge of returning color in his
face, Mr. Sutherland announced as
much to the people, who stood waiting,
thankful that the life was spared;
and then, taking the trembling hand
of his little daughter in his, he gave
his orders.</p>

<p>“Take Tom into my house, and put
him in the south room. Tell Aunt
Dinah that no pains must be spared
to relieve him, and tell Gordon to order
the horse immediately and I will
ride for Dr. Bartier.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FIVE weeks afterward, at the window
of the south room in the mansion
of the Sutherland plantation, in a
deep easy-chair, propped up with pillows,
sat or rather reclined, Tom Alson.
His hands, grown slender and
delicate by long illness, were resting
upon an open letter which lay upon
his knee, and his eyes were wandering
out over the glorious country, with a
little wistfulness in them that had of
late been at home there.</p>

<p>The landscape upon which the sick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
eyes rested was truly a beautiful one.
The rich lands of the plantation
stretched out and away off to the
banks of the Tennessee, the waters of
which were hidden by the cliff-like
shores. Beyond this the mountains
rose, and the eye followed the bends of
the river by their ever-changing
curves. A few of the trees on these
densely-wooded slopes were changing
color, and the scarlet and yellow
among so much green made each color
more intense. The fields which lay
nearer home were truly “white unto
the harvest.” The cotton-buds had
burst everywhere, and over the Southern
hills the fresh breezes of September
were blowing. The hands were
busy in the fields, and Tom counted
many dark forms among the white
cotton, hard at work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>Somehow this first sight of the
fields led Tom’s mind back to the letter
he had received, telling of other
fields, just as “white.” That, and the
letter just received from home, had
sent his thoughts out after his Sunday-school,
of which he had not been able
to hear for so many weeks. He hardly
dared ask after its welfare even now.
But he brought his eyes in from the
window, and they rested upon Lillie,
sitting in a low chair near him, busily
employed in some little manufacture
with cotton and needle. He watched
the white fingers move to and fro in
silence for a few minutes, and then he
said,</p>

<p>“Miss Lillie, I have not been able
to think of my Sunday-school in a
very long time.”</p>

<p>“I have been waiting for you to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
speak of it all the afternoon,” said
Lillie, rousing herself and stopping
her work.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Tom, not daring yet
to ask the question.</p>

<p>“Well,” echoed Lillie, “we consider
ourselves something wonderful, I can
tell you. We have met every Sunday
in the cabin, and Jimmy Harrison—you
know him—reads to us from one
of the new books and the Bible. He
says he cannot pray, so old Uncle Ben
prays, and when it comes the time
you used to speak to us, I tell them
how you are, and what you have been
talking about, and then we all try and
remember what you have told us and
to repeat verses. I did not know
there were so many of the people
learning to love Jesus, Tom. Then,
one Sunday, father came down—it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
that Sunday after you and he were
talking so long in the morning—and
he talked to the people a long time,
and they were all so pleased.”</p>

<p>There was a great sob which prevented
Tom’s reply. He did not know
even then—only God knew—what
had been accomplished during the
summer months on the Sutherland
Plantation.</p>

<p>“Have the books been distributed,
Miss Lillie?” asked Tom when he
could find voice.</p>

<p>“No, only two or three were taken
by Jimmy to read. Then our illuminated
text—that one you said was
prettier than all the rest, ‘We would
see Jesus’—we had put up first over
your chair. We have a little table
that papa sent down, and my velvet
chair stays there now, and last Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the back was covered with a beautiful
wreath of flowers.”</p>

<p>Tom looked out again through dim
eyes over the white fields, and thought
of the promise: “He that goeth forth
weeping, bearing precious seed, shall
doubtless come again with joy, bringing
his sheaves with him.” Tom
thought he had a harvest.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. Sutherland opened the
door and came in, and coming up to
Tom’s chair, asked him “how he was.”</p>

<p>“Very happy indeed, sir,” replied
Tom with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>“What would you like most in the
world just at this minute?” asked
Mr. Sutherland, whose heart always
went out warmly toward the boy who
had saved his child.</p>

<p>Tom’s eyes grew a little wistful.
“I should like most of all to see my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
sister Martha,” said he; “but next to
that,” he added, smiling, “I would like
to have you read to me, Mr. Sutherland.”</p>

<p>So Mr. Sutherland sat down by the
sick boy and read to Tom until the
sunlight faded.</p>

<p>“That was the next best thing to
seeing Martha, sir,” said Tom gratefully
as he finished. “I am very much
obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” replied Mr. Sutherland,
heartily. “Now I am going
away, and I shall send Aunt Dinah to
see that you have what you want for
supper. Come, pet.”</p>

<p>So he went away, taking Lillie
with him, and left happy Tom, sitting
in the twilight, grateful and content,
with the words of the Psalmist making
sweet music in his heart:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“Thou shalt keep him in perfect
peace whose mind is stayed on thee.”</p>

<p>After this first day of pleasure
Tom could not be kept away from the
window, and so, day after day, his
chair was moved up to it, and himself
put into it, all wrapped about with
shawls and supported by pillows, and
left to spend the day by the window.
He had numerous visitors—not too
many—but just enough to make him
feel that he was not alone.</p>

<p>One morning, after he had been up
about a week, he was sitting by the
open window as usual, watching the
cotton-pickers in the distance, when
he heard steps coming up the stairs.
“Somebody is coming to see me,” he
thought, so he listened, still looking
out of the window. Something attracted
his attention there, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
when the door opened he did not
immediately turn his head. There
were quick steps across the floor and
some one came kneeling by his chair,
and then he turned and looked down
into the eager face of his sister
Martha.</p>

<p>“Oh, Martha! Martha!” he cried,
seizing her hand and bending down
to her face, “has God sent me this joy
too? My dear sister, I have wanted
to see you more than anything on
earth.”</p>

<p>“And I am here, Tom,” she replied
joyfully—“come to take good care of
you. Mr. Sutherland wrote me that
you would not send for me for fear I
could not come, but that you wanted
me very much. How are you, dear
Tom?”</p>

<p>“I believe, Martha,” he said, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
holding her hand and looking down
into her face, “I believe I am perfectly
happy.”</p>

<p>“And how is the Sunday-school?”
his sister asked. “Oh, you can’t
think how Miss Mason and I have
enjoyed that school!”</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly wonderful, Martha,”
he replied with glowing eyes. “It
seems to me that for the past few
days, when the thought of it came,
those four grand words, ‘What hath
God wrought?’ have been the only
ones which could anyway rest me.
Listen while I tell.”</p>

<p>Thereupon followed a long conversation
in questions and answers
about the summer’s doings, with
pleased eagerness on one side and
loving sympathy on the other, until
they knew all those little things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
which pen and paper never tell, and
which therefore the letters which had
passed between them had not contained.</p>

<p>“And now, Tom,” said Martha,
when home and plantation news
seemed to be exhausted, “I believe
I’ve something to tell you. Mr.
Sutherland said to me, as we rode up
this morning, that he would like to
keep you all winter if you were
pleased to stay. He said that you
understood his business, and did it
well, and that you had wound yourself
round the hearts of the people;
although,” she added, “I did not need
for him to tell me that, after Jimmy’s
letter.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy?” asked Tom, in amaze.</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Martha. “Jimmy
wrote Miss Mason and me a joint<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
letter of confession of his own sins
and praise of you. It was funny, but
it was good. I will show it to you
some day.”</p>

<p>Tom gave her a bright smile in
answer, and asked her if there was
anything more.</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Martha. “Mr.
Sutherland wants me to stay here too,
to be a sort of waiting-maid for Miss
Lillie. How do you like that?”</p>

<p>“My dear Martha, that is glorious,”
said Tom, bringing his hands together
with sudden joy. “There will be no
discouragements if you are here.”</p>

<p>“But, Tom dear,” said Martha, “I
would not stay, and I should not want
to leave you, but in the fall the good
people who sent Miss Mason to us in
Huntsville are going to send a teacher
to this plantation, and Mr. Sutherland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
is perfectly willing. So we may study
yet, Tom.”</p>

<p>“There is no truer word in the
world than that which God spake,
Martha,” replied Tom, looking into
her gentle, earnest face with glistening
eyes: “‘All things work together
for good to them that love God.’</p>

<p>And now, dear reader, I had
meant to leave you here, and let the
story of Tom’s summer work leave its
own impress on your minds and
hearts, but when I think of the joy,
and love, and reward of working for
Jesus, and the faintness with which I
have tried to show them to you, I am
longing for power to carry home the
truth to your hearts. But God who
giveth the increase will bring it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
pass when human hands fall powerless.</p>

<p>Do you remember how John finished
his gospel? He says: “And there
are also many other things which
Jesus did, the which if they should be
written every one, I suppose that even
the world itself could not contain the
books that should be written.” So I
believe, with him, that if the beauty
and joy of the lives spent in work for
the Lord were given to mankind,
“even the world itself could not
contain the books that should be
written.”</p>
